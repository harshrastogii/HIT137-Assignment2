This repository contains the solutions for the HIT137 Group Assignment 2. The assignment involves solving three programming problems. Each problem is solved using Python.
 
## Questions
1. **Question 1:** Encrypt and decrypt a text file.
2. **Question 2:** Analyze temperature data.
3. **Question 3:** Generate a recursive tree pattern using Python's turtle graphics.
 
## How to Run the Programs
### Question 1: Encrypt/Decrypt Text
1. Place the `raw_text.txt` file in the root directory.
2. Run the `p1.py`script.
3. Encrypted text will be saved in `encrypted_text.txt`.
4. Decrypted text will be saved in `decrypted_text.txt`.
5. Decryption verification will be displayed on the console.

### Question 2: Analyze Temperature Data
1. Place all temperature CSV files in the `temperatures_data/` folder.
2. Run the `temperature_analysis.py` script.
3. Results will be saved in the `temperature_analysis results/` folder:
   - `average_temp.txt`: Monthly average temperatures for all stations.
   - `largest_temp_range_station.txt`: Station with the largest temperature range.
   - `warmest_and_coolest_station.txt`: Warmest and coolest stations.
 
### Question 3: Recursive Tree Pattern
1. Run the `Recursive Turtle.py` script.
2. A window will open, showing the tree pattern.
3. Close the window to exit.
